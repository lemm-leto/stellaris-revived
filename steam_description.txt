[h1][b]Stellaris Revived: Terrforming[/b][/h1]
This mod aims to improve terraforming experience in Stellaris by adding step-by-step terraforming with megastructures and unique buildings.

This makes following changes to gameplay:
[b]Terraforming[/b]
	[list]
		[*]Megastructures:
			[list]
				[*]Terraforming Station Platform. A platform for a future terraforming station
				[*]Base terraforming station. Turns the planet into nascent world
				[*]Climate specific terraforming station (Dry, Wet & Cold). Turns the planet into dry, wet or cold world. It is allowed to switch terraforming station focus simply by upgrading a megastructure. Requires ecological adaptation tech
				[*]Planet class specific terraforming station (arid, continental, arctic, etc.). Turns the planet into one of vanilla planet class. It is allowed to switch terraforming station focus simply by upgrading a megastructure. Requires climate restoration tech
				[*]Gaia terraforming station. Allows to turn the planet into gaia world. Requires 'World Shaper' ascension perk, could only be build on top of planet class specific terraforming station. Requires climate restoration tech
				[*]Machine & Hive terraforming stations. Vey similar to Gaia terraforming station. Requires corresponding ascension perk and allows to terraform the planet into machine or hive world.
				[*]Core Igniter. Requires ascension perk 'Star Shaper' and technology 'Core Igniter'. Allows to turn the gas giant into the star which will make some of it's moons gaia worlds.
				[*]Gas Giant Terraforming station. Requires ascension perk 'Star Shaper' and technology 'Gas Giant Terraforming'. Allows to build terraforming station on gas giant's orbit to turn it into nascent world.
			[/list]
		[*]New planet classes
			[list]
				[*]Nascent World. A lot of blockers, more suitable for resource extraction. First step in making planet habitable
				[*]Dry World. An intermediate stage on the way to arid, desert or savanna planet classes
				[*]Wet World. An intermediate stage on the way to continental, ocean or tropical planet classes
				[*]Cold World. An intermediate stage on the way to alpine, arctic or tundra planet classes
			[/list]
	[/list]


[h2]How To Use[/h2]
	[list]
		[*]Step 1. Build terraforming station platform on the planet's orbit. Tech terrestrial sculpting is required.
		[*]Step 2. Upgrade terraforming station planet to a full terraforming station.
		[*]Step 3. You now can choose a desired climate by upgrading the terraforming station into dry, wet or cold station type.
		[*]Step 4. You now can choose a desired planet class by upgrading the terraforming station into arid, continental, arctic, etc. station type.
		[*]Step 5 (Optional). It is also possible to upgrade station to gaia type if you have required ascension perk.

[h2]Changelog[/h2]
[list]
	[*]2.1.0
		[list]
			[*]Added support for machine & hive empires
			[*]New ascension perk 'Star Shaper' which allows to turn the gas giant into the star after researching technology. Also allows to build terraforming station on the gas giant's orbit to turn it into nascent world.
		[/list]
	[*]2.0.0
		[list]
			[*]Total overhaul of the terraforming approach. Now you should build and upgrade 'Terraforming station' megastructure in order to change planet class
  		[*]Full AI support
  		[*]Economics rebalanced
  		[*]It is also allowed to build terraforming station on already habitable or colonizeable planet to manipulate it's climate
			[*]Not savegame compatible (old terraforming facilities will be broken on save load as well as planets which were not terraformed)
		[/list]
	[*]1.3.0
		[list]
			[*]Added AI support via events due to the dumb economic plans
			[*]Rebalance buildings cost
		[/list]
	[*]1.2.0
		[list]
			[*]Terraforming stages 3 & 4 implemented. Now it is possible to convert the planet into vanilla type via new buildings. If you have ascension perk you now also can convert the planet into Gaia World by building a single "Deep Thought" building.
			[*]Update to support 2.7.2
			[*]Not savegame compatible (Planet type chances upon terraforming completion might be broken)
		[/list]
	[*]1.1.0
		[list]
			[*]Terraforming stage 2 implemented. Now it is possible to build extra terraforming buildings which allow to turn the planet into dry, wet or cold world. Those new world types are intermediate stage for a vanilla planet classes
			[*]Switched terraforming blockers from deposits to planet modificators
			[*]New planet types. Wet, Dry & Cold worlds
			[*]New stage 1 buildings and planet modificators
			[*]New deposits for nascent world
			[*]Make nascent world more usable by allowing to extract rare resources & build scientific district there
			[*]Update to support 2.7.1 version
			[*]Not savegame compatible. For existing terraforming facilities there is no way to update planet modifiers. I suggest to remove existing facilities by selecting it and then using command "event utopia.3324" in console
		[/list]
	[*]1.0.0 Terraforming
		[list]
			[*]New terraforming approach via new megastructure which allows to turn barren planet into minimal habitable
		[/list]
